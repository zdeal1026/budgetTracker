## Description

We were given a starter application and asked to make it available offline. This was a fairly difficult task. Thankfully, the application was already given to us and we just needed to add indexdb, service-worker.js, manifest.webmanifest and other small things to make it work. My biggest error came from nanming the manifest.webmanifest file as manifest.json. It took a while to figure out this error but after much help with my tutor, I was able to tackle this assignment.
